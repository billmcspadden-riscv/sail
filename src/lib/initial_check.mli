val opt_undefined_gen : bool ref

(** Generate faster undefined_T functions. Rather than generating
   functions that allow for the undefined values of enums and variants
   to be picked at runtime using a RNG or similar, this creates
   undefined_T functions for those types that simply return a specific
   member of the type chosen at compile time, which is much
   faster. These functions don't have the right effects, so the
   -no_effects flag may be needed if this is true. False by
   default. *)

val opt_enum_casts : bool ref

(** This is a bit of a hack right now - it ensures that the undefiend
   builtins (undefined_vector etc), only get added to the AST
   once. The original assumption in sail is that the whole AST gets
   processed at once (therefore they could only get added once), and
   this isn't true any more with the interpreter. This needs to be
   public so the interpreter can set it back to false if it unloads
   all the loaded files. *)
