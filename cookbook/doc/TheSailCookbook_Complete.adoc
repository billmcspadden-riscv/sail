[#list_of_programming_examples]
== List of programming examples (in increasing complexity)

The main purpose of this document,  is to give the user a quick
reference to Sail coding examples. The following is a list of
all the programming examples found in this document.

<<hello_world>>

<<my_replicate_bits>>

== Introduction

Sail is a programming language that was developed for the purpose
of clearly, concisely and completely describing a computer's
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).  This includes...

- specifying the opcodes/instructions and their behaviours
- specifying the general purpose registers
- specifying the control space registers

Sail was the language chosen by RISC-V International
to formally specify the RISC-V open source ISA.

This document,  while not RISC-V specific,  is especially targeted for engineers who are working on specifying the RISC-V ISA.

This cookbook is intended to supply the beginning Sail programmer with
some simple, well-commented, bite-size program fragments that can
be compiled and run.

**github** is used to host the development of Sail.  You can find the
repository at the following URL:

https://github.com/rems-project/sail

Currently,  the work on this cookbook can be found on a branch in the
above repo.  This branch is:

https://github.com/billmcspadden-riscv/sail/tree/cookbook_br

So this is the place you should probably clone.  (Eventually,  this
branch will be merged to the release branch.)

Other documentation:

There is another useful Sail document that you should know about.  It is
"The Sail instruction-set semantics specification language" by Armstrong, et. al.  It can be found at:

https://github.com/billmcspadden-riscv/sail/blob/cookbook_br/manual.pdf

While useful,  the document does not contain a useful set of programming
examples.  That is the purpose of *this* document.


== How to contribute (Bill)

We are hopeful that as you learn the Sail programming language,  that you too would want to create some code snippets that you think someone might find helpful.

The simple "hello world" program (found in cookbook/functional_code_snippets/hello_world/) provides a template for writing a new code snippet. For an example
that lives in a single Sail file, this should be sufficient.  Create a test directory (with a useful name), copy the Makefile and the .sail file into that directory,  and then write your code.  And finally,
edit this .adoc file and give a description of what
the example file is intended to do.

Once you have completed your snippet and verifies that it works,  you should make an entry in this document.  Pleas see <<hello_world>> to see how you should include your snippet in this document.  You should at least include the .sail file and give a brief descritpion.  Also, please make an entry in
<<list_of_programming_examples>> for quick perusal by readers.


=== Coding and indentation style

We do not have a preferred coding style for these little code snippets.  With regards to indentation style,  the RISC-V modle follows a vaguely K&R style. Some of the program snippets (those originating with Bill McSpadden) follow the Whitesmiths indentation style.  All styles are welcome.

For a list and description of popular indentation styles, steer your browser to...
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style.

=== Brevity

Program examples should be short, both in terms of number-of-lines and in terms of execution time.  Each example should focus on one simple item.  And the execution of the example item should be clear.  The example should be short, standalone and easy to maintain.

Now,  we do have one example in this Cookbook that somewhat violates this request.  The programming example, <<simple_cpu_exampl>>,  is more complex.  But it is meant to demonstrate the usefulness of Sail in defining the functionality of an ISA.

=== Maintainership (when something breaks)

We would also ask that if you contribute a code example,  that you would maintain it.

=== Syntax highlighting for Sail

Syntax highlighting for several editors (emacs, vim, Visual Studio, etc)
can be found at:

https://github.com/rems-project/sail/tree/sail2/editors

It is beyond the scope of this document to describe how to use
the syntax highlighting for the various editors.

== Sail installation

Sail is supported on a number of different platforms.  MacOs and Lunix/Ubuntu seem to be the most used platforms.



TBD

=== Ubuntu (Bill Mc.)

TBD

=== MacOS (Martin)

TBD

=== Docker

Docker is used as a ....

=== Windows
Support of a native command line interface is not planned.  If you
want to run Sail under Windows,  plan on running it under Cygwin.

=== Windows: Cygwin (Bill Mc.,  low priority)

If there is a demand,  a port to Cygwin will be attempted.

=== Other?

Are there other OS platforms that should be supported?
Other Linux distis?  Or will Docker support?

== Basic description
=== What Sail is
Sail is a programming language that is targetted for
 specifying an ISA.  Once specified, a set of
instructions (usually found in a .elf file) can then
be executed on the "model" and the results observed.

The model is a sequential model only;  at this time,
there are no semantics allowing for any type of parallel
execution.

=== What sail is not
Sail is not an RTL (Register Transfer Language).
There is no direct support for timing (as in clock
timing) and there is no support for parallel execution,
all things that an RTL contains.

=== version management and what to expect
TBD

[#hello_world]
== “Hello, World” example program (Bill)
All example programs associated with this cookbook,
can be found in
<sail_git_root>/cookbook/functional_code_snippets/

The purpose of this simple program is to show some
of the basics of Sail and to ensure that you have
the Sail compiler (and the other required tools)
 installed in your environment.

It is assumed that you have built the sail compiler
in the local area. The Makefiles in the coding
examples depend on this.

The following code snippet comes from:

https://github.com/billmcspadden-riscv/sail/tree/cookbook_br/cookbook/functional_code_snippets/hello_world

hello_world.sail:

// include doesn't appear to render in github
// Therefore, asciidoctor-reducer will be used to create
// a complete (all files included) file, which will be
// committed by git.

[source, sail]
----

// ==========================================================================

// Two types of comments...
// This type and ...

/*
...block comments
*/

// Whitespace is NOT significant. Yay!

default Order dec   // Required. Defines whether bit vectors are increasing
                    // (inc) (MSB is index 0 or decreasing (dec) (LSB is index 0)

// The $include directive is used to pull in other Sail code.
//  It functions similarly, but not exactly the same, as the
//  C preproessor directrive.

// Sail is a very small language.  In order to get a set
//  of useful functionality (eg - print to stdout), a set
//  of functions and datatypes are defined in the file
//  "prelude.sail"
$include <prelude.sail>

// ========================================================
// Function signatures (same idea as C's function prototype)
// ========================================================

val "print" : string -> unit

val main : unit -> unit

// ========================================================
// The entry point into the program starts at the function, main.
// ========================================================
function main() =
    {
    print("hello, world!\n") ;
    print("hello, another world!\n") ;
    }

----

So... that's the code we want to compile.  But how do
we compile it? Remember, we want to use the sail
compiler that was built in this sandbox.  We use a
'make' methodology for building.  The first Makefile
(in the same directory as the example code example)
is very simple.  It includes a generic Makefile
(../Makefile.generic) that is used for building
most of the program examples.


[Note]  If you want to create and contribute your
own example program and you need to deviate from
our make methodolgy,  you would do that in your
own test directory by writing your own Makefile.

The basic flow for building is:

. Write *.sail
. sail -c *.sail -o out.c
. gcc <flags> *.c --> executable


Makefile:

[source, makefile]

# vim: set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 noexpandtab

Makefile.generic is the Makefile that does the work for compilation.
It depends on a local compilation of sail. See the [Installation](#sail-installation)
section to understand how to install in the tools for your platform.

What does the compilation process look like?  Under Ubuntu Linux,  this
is the output you can expect for compiling and running the "hello world"
example program.

```
ubuntu-VirtualBox 227> make
SAIL_DIR=../../.. ; export SAIL_DIR ; \
../../../sail -c -o out hello_world.sail
gcc out.c ../../../lib/*.c  -lgmp -lz -I ../../../lib/ -o out
./out
hello, world!
hello, another world!
ubuntu-VirtualBox 228>

```

Now that we've examined the Makefiles,  we will make little mention of them
in the rest of this document (except for the example where we discuss the
C foreign function interface where we will show how Sail can call C functions).

=== "Hello, World" and the Sail interactive interpretter

This section is meant to introduce you to the the Sail interactive interpretter.
We will not go into much detail about running it;  we'll simply take you through the
hello_world example to show you how it is run.

'1. Invocation....

'2. Execute the main() function....

'3. Each "step" in the following images is caused by hitting the "enter" key.
This steps you from one statement to another.  Note the top line: we are being
told we are in the main() function.

What does " 'n " mean?

=== Bits

=== Lists

=== Structs

=== mappings

=== Type declarations

Sail is a modern programming language, in the ML tradition and has
many forms of type constructors, in particular structs, unions, enums
and bitfields. TBC

=== Type declarations (1): Structs

Note, as of 28 July 2022,  pattern matching on structs is not possible. See https://github.com/rems-project/sail/issues/179

=== Type declarations (2): Unions
=== Type declarations (3): Enums
=== Type declarations (4): Bitfields

Bitfields are a staple of ISA specifications, and Sail offers convenient support for bitfields. Here is an example from the RISCV specification:

[source, sail]
----
bitfield Mtvec : xlenbits = {
  Base : xlen - 1 .. 2,
  Mode : 1 .. 0
}
register mtvec : Mtvec  /* Trap Vector */

----

A bitfield definition creates a wrapper around a bit vector type, and
automatically generates getters and setters for the fields, in case of the example `mtvec`, we have

- Getter: `mtvec->bits()`
- Setter: `mtvec->bits() = ...`

for the whole bitvector, and for individual fields

- Getters:
    * `mtvec.Base()`
    * `mtvec.Mode()`
- Setters:
  * `mtvec.Base() = ...`
  * `mtvec.Mode() = ...`

The bitfield wrapper type will be the something like `union cr = { Mk_cr(bits(xlen)) }`
TODO: this example is too RISCV specific (requires `xlenbits`), use something more generic.


=== Liquid data types (Martin)

[#my_replicate_bits]
=== The ``my_replicate_bits()`` function from the Sail manual (Bill)

First,  let's look at the code that is described in the Sail manual for the function, my_replicate_bits().

Note:
The following code actually comes from the file
doc/examples/my_replicate_bits.sail.  It is a little
bit different than what is shown in the manual
for reasons that will be covered later.

function my_replicate_bits(n, xs) = {

  foreach (i from 1 to n) {
    ys = ys << length(xs);
    ys = ys | zero_extend(xs, length(ys))
  };
  ys
}

val my_replicate_bits_2 : forall 'n 'm, 'm >= 1 & 'n >= 1. (int('n), bits('m)) -> bits('n * 'm)

function my_replicate_bits_2(n, xs) = {
  ys = zeros('n * 'm);
  foreach (i from 1 to n) {
    ys = (ys << 'm) | zero_extend(xs, 'n * 'm)
  };
  ys
}

// The following comment is of interest for reasons other than
//  functionality.  The Sail syntax is still being developed.
//  Attention should be paid to the issues reported to the Sail
//  team (via github) and when releases are made (again via github).

// The following is deprecated per Alasdair Armstrong:
//  I would just remove that example as the cast feature is now
//  deprecated in the latest version (and the risc-v model has
//  always used a flag fully disabling it anyway)

// val cast extz : forall 'n 'm, 'm >= 'n. (implicit('m), bits('n)) -> bits('m)
//
//function extz(m, xs) = zero_extend(xs, m)
//
//val my_replicate_bits_3 : forall 'n 'm, 'm >= 1 & 'n >= 1. (int('n), bits('m)) -> bits('n * 'm)
//
//function my_replicate_bits_3(n, xs) = {
//  ys = zeros('n * 'm);
//  foreach (i from 1 to n) ys = ys << 'm | xs;
//  ys
//}
----

You will see in this code,  that there is no 'main'
function,  and as such, will not compile into a C Sail
model.  You will get the following error message:

TODO: get the error message.

In order to get this to compile into a C Sail model,
you will need to provide a main function.  The
following code shows the implementation of a
`main()` function that calls my_replicate bits().

----

Because both the files, my_replicate_bits.sail and
main.sail, need to have the function signatures in
order to compile (and we want them to be consistent),
the function signatures have been put into a seperate
file that is include by both.  Here is the function

== Interaction between C and Sail

**Can we call Sail functions in the C model?**

Short answer: yes!

In more detail, every Sail function will show up with a predictable name in the generated C (with one caveat). For example, if have the following Sail code:

[source, sail]
----
default Order dec
$include <prelude.sail>

val giraffe1 : unit -> int
function giraffe1 ()  = {
	 return 1
}

val giraffe2 : unit -> int

function giraffe3 () -> int = {
	 return 3
}

val giraffe4 : unit -> int
function giraffe4 () = {
	 return 4
}


val main : unit -> int effect {rreg, wreg}
function main () = {
    let x1 = giraffe1() in
    let x2 = giraffe2() in
    let x3 = giraffe3() in
	return 7

}




----

then we get the following C code (abbreviated).

[source, c]
----
void zgiraffe1(sail_int *rop, unit);

void zgiraffe1(sail_int *zcbz30, unit zgsz30)
{
   ...
}
----

for `giraffe1` (and likewise for 'giraffe3'). Note that the  code for `giraffe2` is simply this:

[source, c]
----
void zgiraffe2(sail_int *rop, unit);

----

So giraffe1 becomes `zgiraffe1`, `giraffe2` becomes `zgiraffe2`` and so on. If we only provide a
Sail declaration but no corresponding Sail implementation (as we do for `giraffe2`, we only get a C declaration. OTOH,
if we only provide a Sail function but no separate
Sail header, as we do for `giraffe3`,
we still get a C implementation and a separate prototype.

Note that all the `zgiraffe*` functions are global and can be called from C. This is done for example in the RISCV model, where the Sail functions

- `tick_platform` https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/blob/master/model/riscv_platform.sail#L495
- `tick_clock` https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/blob/master/model/riscv_platform.sail#L319

are explicitly called in the handwritten C function

https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/blob/master/c_emulator/riscv_sim.c#L935-L936

Note that if you overload a functions `f1`, ..., `fn` to a new funtion `f` and then
call `f` in the Sail code, the generated C will not use `zf` but rather the appropriate `zfi`. For example


[source, sail]
----
default Order dec
$include <prelude.sail>

val giraffe1 : unit -> int
function giraffe1 ()  = {
	 return 1
}

function giraffe2 ( n : int ) -> int = {
	 return n
}

overload giraffe = { giraffe1, giraffe2 }

val main : unit -> int effect {rreg, wreg}
function main () = {
    let x1 = giraffe() in
    let x2 = giraffe( 17 ) in
	return x2

}



----

results in the following C snippet:

[source, c]
----
void zgiraffe1(sail_int *rop, unit);
void zgiraffe1(sail_int *zcbz30, unit zgsz30) { ... }

void zgiraffe2(sail_int *rop, sail_int);
void zgiraffe2(sail_int *zcbz31, sail_int zn) { ... }

void zmain(sail_int *zcbz32, unit zgsz32)
{
  ...
  zgiraffe1(&zx1, UNIT);
  ...
    zgiraffe2(&zx2, zgsz33);
  ...
}
----

Scattered definitions (typically used in the decode and execute clauses) might be seen as a form of overloading. Here is an example of a definition of `execute``:

[source, sail]
----
default Order dec
$include <prelude.sail>


scattered union ast
val execute : ast -> int

union clause ast = ITYPE : int
function clause execute ITYPE(i) = { return 17 }

union clause ast = BTYPE : bool
function clause execute BTYPE(b) = { return 19 }

union clause ast = RTYPE : real
function clause execute BTYPE(r) = { return 23 }

union clause ast = BVTYPE : bits(32)
function clause execute BTYPE(bv) = { return 29 }

end execute
end ast
----

Here the generated C will contain a single function `zexecute` that does a big `case`-distinction that dispatches to the relevant parts of the scattered definition:

[source, c]
----
void zexecute(sail_int *rop, struct zast);

void zexecute(sail_int *zcbz30, struct zast zmergez3var)
{
    ...
    if (zmergez3var.kind != Kind_zITYPE) goto case_2;
    ...
    CONVERT_OF(sail_int, mach_int)(&zgsz31, INT64_C(17));
    ...
case_2:
    ...
    CONVERT_OF(sail_int, mach_int)(&zgsz33, INT64_C(19));
    ...
case_3:
    ...
    CONVERT_OF(sail_int, mach_int)(&zgsz35, INT64_C(23));
   ...
}
----

**Warning.** The Sail compiler does aggressive  dead code elimination: Sail functions, like `giraffe4` which are not used (called) get eliminated and do **not** appear in the generated C code.

**Note.** See https://github.com/rems-project/sail/issues/177

Here's another example of using the C foreign language interface...

installed on your system in order to build the test.

== Other stuff

[#scattered-definitions]
=== Scattered definitions:  Why?  What are they?

When specifying an ISA,  you'd like to coalesce the defintions of an
instruction (or a set of instructions,  if they have some similarity to
each other) into a single file.  One benefit of such organizational principles
is that you can take a single Sail file and import it into a text specification
when describing the instructions whithout having to tear apart a much larger
file.

Functions, unions and mappings are definitions that can be scattered amongst
multiple files.  Following is an example of scattered definitions of functions,
unions and mappings.

Here is the opening of the scattered definitions for this example:

[source, sail]
----
// vim: set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
// ============================================================================
// File:    scattered_definitions_begin.sail

scattered function  func
scattered function  print_enum_to_string
scattered mapping   enum_to_string

----

Here is the top-level Sail module. Note that it calls 2 instances of
func(), the difference being the "argument" that is passed to it.  But it's
not really an argument;  the "argument" is used to decide which flavor of func()
should be called.

The file, scattered_definitions_include.sail, is use to hold function signatures,
which get included in several files.

----

Here are the 2 scattered definitions for func(),  found in 2 different files:

[source, sail]
----
// vim: set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
// ============================================================================
// File:    a.sail

//$include <prelude.sail>
//$include "./prelude.sail"
$include "scattered_definitions_include.sail"

function clause func(a_enum_e) =
    {
    print("a.sail string: ") ;
    print("\n") ;
    }

mapping clause enum_to_string = a_enum_e    <->     "a"
//  {                               // Brackets with a single mapping item gives compile error
//  a_enum_e    <->     "a"
//  }

// TODO:  Need a method for iterating through a mapping
function clause print_enum_to_string(a_enum_e) =
    {
    print("");
    }



----

[source, sail]
----
// vim: set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
// ============================================================================
// File:    b.sail

//$include <prelude.sail>
//$include "./prelude.sail"
$include "scattered_definitions_include.sail"

function clause func(b_enum_e) =
    {
    print("b.sail string: ");
    print("\n");
    }

mapping clause enum_to_string = b_enum_e    <->     "b"
//  {                               // Brackets with a single mapping item gives compile error
//  b_enum_e    <->     "b"
//  }

// TODO:  Need a method for iterating through a mapping
function clause print_enum_to_string(b_enum_e) =
    {
    print("");
    }




----

And here is where the scattered definition of func() is end'd.  The end'ing is
broken out into a separate file so that many (all?) scattered definitions can
be closed in the same place.  This should match the opening of scattered definitions
being done in one place.

[source, sail]
----
// vim: set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
// ============================================================================
// File:    scattered_definition_end.sail


end func
end print_enum_to_string
end enum_to_string


----

And finally, there is an order of compilation of Sail code that must be observed.
The scattered definitions must be compiled last.  As such,  the Makefile
specifies the compilation order as seen here:

[source, makefile]
----
# vim: set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 noexpandtab
# ================================================================

# For this example,  Sail compile order is important.
#	The ending of scattered definitions appear in scattered_definitions_end.sail,
#	so this must be the last file.
SAIL_SRC	:=  scattered_definitions_begin.sail \
				scattered_definitions.sail \
				a.sail \
				b.sail \
				scattered_definitions_end.sail

include ../Makefile.generic

[#q-what-are-the-purposes-of-text-constructs-things-like-include-optimize-etc]
==== Q: What are the purposes of "$\<text\>" constructs,  things like $include, $optimize, etc?

$<...> runs what might be called the preprocessor (for directives like `$include <prelude.sail>`).
Note that, unlike C, the Sail preprocessor works (recursively) on Sail ASTs rather than strings.
Note that such directives that are used are preserved in the AST, so they also function as a useful
way to pass auxiliary information to the various Sail backends.

Sail also calls those pragmas. Sail has a few pragmas that can be invoked with $..., see

   https://github.com/rems-project/sail/blob/sail2/src/process_file.ml#L164-L181

Pragmas are useful if you want to extend the existing Sail system. We have some extensions in our
internal version of Sail that are using $...

"$\<text\>" is also called a "splice" because it's used to 'splice' code in.

[#q-is-there-a-library-methodology-for-sail]
==== Q: Is there a library methodology for Sail?::

Use $include for common code

Ideally, Sail would support a proper module system. This would be especially useful for a modular architecture
like RISCV. Form a pure Sail language perspective, it is not problem adding a well-designed module system
(like OCaml's) to Sail. However, it's an open problem how to compile such a module system to Coq (IIRC).
It's probably a solvable research question but nobody seems to be working on this. So for the time being,
we will have to stay with "$include <...>"

[#q-is-there-support-for-variable-argument-lists-in-sail]
==== Q: Is there support for variable argument lists in Sail?  What about print() functions?

A: No,  there is not support for varargs type functions at this time.

For print() functions,  do something like...

print("this is  a string with an int, "); print_int(foobar); print("\n");


[#q-rvfidii-what-is-it]
==== Q: RVFI_DII:  What is it?

A: See https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/TestRIG/blob/master/RVFI-DII.md


[#q__what_does_the_skid_underscore_character_mean_in_Sail]
==== Q: What does the skid/underscore character, '_',  mean in Sail?

A:  The '_' character is the default pattern match token.

[#q-what-does-unit-mean-in-Sail-what-is-its-purpose]
==== Q: What does 'unit' mean in Sail?  What is its purpose?

A: (From Alasdair Armstrong) 'unit' is like 'void *' in C.

[#q-what-is-the-difference-between-Int-int-integer]
==== Q: What is the difference between 'Int', 'int', 'integer'?

A: (per Alisdair Armstrong)  'Int' in the Sail typing system, is a 'kind'.
A data 'kind' has parametricity. Other data 'kinds' are Type, Order, Bool.

'int' and 'integer' are datatypes.  However, they are not fixed length.
Sail uses a multiprecision package in order to have varying integer sizes,
even greater than 64 bits,  or 128 bits.  The compute system provides the
maximal limit on integer size.

[#q-i-would-like-to-iterate-through-a-mapping]
==== Q: I would like to iterate through a mapping.  Can I do that?

A:  No,  not at this time.  Here is Alasdair's answer to the question:

We don't have any kind of reflection in Sail, so to do things like walk
over the set of mappings the best way is to write some OCaml code to do
that (if I understand the question correctly). You can import Sail as an
OCaml library and then programmatically manipulate and inspect the Sail
specification as needed. The only downside is the API isn't stable
between Sail versions.


[#q-what-is-the-difference-in-the-function-signatures-quotes-vs-no-quotes]
==== Q: What is the difference in the function signatures, `val "function_a" : string -> unit` and `val  function_a  : string -> unit` ?  What do the double quotes indicate?

A:  TBAnswered

[#q---is-there-native-support-in-Sail-for-processing-command-line-arguments]
==== Q:  Is there native support in Sail for processing command line arguments for the C emulator?

A: There is no native support for `argc/argv` data types.

However,  in the C foreign interface,  you can process the arguments in the
`main()` routine and provide a mechanism for Sail to see the values.

An example of this is done in the RISC-V model. See the file, `c_emulator/riscv_sim.c`,
for the example.

[#q_is_there_support_for_multi_hart_multi_core_simulation]
==== Q: Is there support for multi-HART or multi-Core simulation?

A: There is no inherent support for multi-HART or multi-Core within the existing RISC-V Sail model.
There are future plans for adding this kind of simulation.  It is needed in order to simulate
(in a meaningful way) the atomic memory operations and to evaluate memory consistency
and coherency.

//  ( Subject: RISC-V Sail model questions, round 1: Multi-core, MTIMER, MMIO, main loop)
//  ( Date: Feb 15, 2022, 7:20AM)

The model isn't directly about testing. Testing is a separate
activity. The point of the model is to be as clear as possible. and we
should keep testing and the model separate.

[#q_what_are_ml_files__what_are_their_purpose]
==== Q: What are .ml files?  What are their purpose?

A: These are OCaml files. They are to the ocaml emulator what the .c
files are to the c emulator. I question the need for an OCaml emulator
,see also https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/issues/138

[#q__is_there_any_support_for_MTIMER]
==== Q: Is there any support for MTIMER?

A: Yes.  MTIMER functionality lives in riscv_platform.sail.  At this date (2022-05-27) it lives
at a fixed MMIO space as specified by the MCONFIG CSR.  In the future, once the Golden Model supports
the RISCV_config YAML structure, the MTIMER can be assigned any address.

[#q__is_the__main_loop__coded_in_Sail]
==== Q: Is the "main loop" coded in Sail?

A: Yes.  The main execution loop can be found in main.sail.

[#q-can-gdb-attach-to-the-riscv-golden-model-to-debug-riscv-code]
==== Q: Can gdb attach to the RISCV Golden Model to debug RISCV code?

A:  Not at this time (2022-05-27).  It is being looked at as an enhancement.

[#q__why_two_executables]
==== Q: There are two C executables built: riscv_sim_RV32 and riscv_sim_RV64. Is there a reason why we need two executables? Can't XLEN be treated as a run-time setting rather than a compile time setting?

A:  (Response from Martin Berger) I think this would require a redesign of the Sail code because of the way Sail's liquid types work. Currently xlen is a global type constant, that is used, directly or indirectly, everywhere. As a type-constant it is used during type checking. The typing system might (note the subjunctive) be flexible enough to turn this into a type-parameter, but probably not without major code surgery. I think we should ask the Cambridge team why they decided on the current approach.

[#q___is_there_support_in_the_model_for_misaligned_memory_accesses]
==== Q:  Is there support in the model for misaligned memory accesses?

A: (Response from Martin Berger) Short answer: I don't know. Alignment stuff is distributed all over the code base.  riscv_platform.sail has some configuration options for this. Maybe that's a place to start looking?
