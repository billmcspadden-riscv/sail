== Introduction

Sail is a programming language that was developed for the purpose
of clearly, concisely and completely describing a computer's 
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).  This includes...

- specifying the opcodes/instructions and their behaviours
- specifying the general purpose registers
- specifying the control space registers

Sail was the language chosen by RISC-V International 
to formally specify the RISC-V open source ISA.

This document,  while not RISC-V specific,  is especially targeted for engineers who are working on specifying the RISC-V ISA. 

This cookbook is intended to supply the beginning Sail programmer with
some simple, well-commented, bite-size program fragments that can
be compiled and run.

**github** is used to host the development of Sail.  You can find the 
repository at the following URL:

https://github.com/rems-project/sail

Currently,  the work on this cookbook can be found on a branch in the
above repo.  This branch is:

https://github.com/billmcspadden-riscv/sail/tree/cookbook_br

So this is the place you should probably clone.  (Eventually,  this
branch will be merged to the release branch.)

Other documentation:

There is another useful Sail document that you should know about.  It is
"The Sail instruction-set semantics specification language" by Armstrong, et. al.  It can be found at:

https://github.com/billmcspadden-riscv/sail/blob/cookbook_br/manual.pdf

While useful,  the document does not contain a useful set of programming
examples.  That is the purpose of *this* document.


== How to contribute (Bill)

We are hopeful that as you learn the Sail programming language,  that you too would want to create some code snippets that you think someone might find helpful.

The simple "hello world" program (found in cookbook/functional_code_snippets/hello_world/) provides a template for writing a new code snippet. For an example 
that lives in a single Sail file, this should be sufficient.  Create a test directory (with a useful name), copy the Makefile and the .sail file into that directory,  and then write your code.  And finally,
edit this .adoc file and give a description of what
the example file is intended to do.

Once you have completed your snippet and verifies that it works,  you should make an entry in this document.  Pleas see <<hello_world>> to see how you should include your snippet in this document.  You should at least include the .sail file and give a brief descritpion.  Also, please make an entry in 
<<list_of_programming_examples>> for quick perusal by readers.


=== Coding and indentation style

We do not have a preferred coding style for these little code snippets.  With regards to indentation style,  the RISC-V modle follows a vaguely K&R style. Some of the program snippets (those originating with Bill McSpadden) follow the Whitesmiths indentation style.  All styles are welcome.

For a list and description of popular indentation styles, steer your browser to...
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style.

=== Brevity

Program examples should be short, both in terms of number-of-lines and in terms of execution time.  Each example should focus on one simple item.  And the execution of the example item should be clear.  The example should be short, standalone and easy to maintain.

Now,  we do have one example in this Cookbook that somewhat violates this request.  The programming example, <<simple_cpu_exampl>>,  is more complex.  But it is meant to demonstrate the usefulness of Sail in defining the functionality of an ISA.

=== Maintainership (when something breaks)

We would also ask that if you contribute a code example,  that you would maintain it.

=== Syntax highlighting for Sail

Syntax highlighting for several editors (emacs, vim, Visual Studio, etc)
can be found at:

https://github.com/rems-project/sail/tree/sail2/editors

It is beyond the scope of this document to describe how to use
the syntax highlighting for the various editors.

== Sail installation

Sail is supported on a number of different platforms.  MacOs and Lunix/Ubuntu seem to be the most used platforms.  



TBD

=== Ubuntu (Bill Mc.)

TBD

=== MacOS 


Installation with `brew` and `opam` is straighforward. On my
MacBook Pro, with an M1 Processor, runniung Ventura 13.0.1, I followed
the instructions at https://github.com/rems-project/sail/blob/sail2/INSTALL.md[]


I use brew (https://brew.sh/) to install software. With brew I install opam https://opam.ocaml.org/ and Ocaml itself (https://ocaml.org/). Then I follow these steps:

----
    ocaml -version
    eval $(opam config env)
    xcode-select --install
    brew install gmp z3 pkg-config
    opam install sail
----

Depending what is already installed on your computer, some of the above my not be necessary. When running `opam install sail` you will be asked `Do you want to continue?` and you need to answer `y`. You can run `sail -v` to see what version you have installed. 

=== Docker

Docker is used as a ....

=== Windows 
Support of a native command line interface is not planned.  If you
want to run Sail under Windows,  plan on running it under Cygwin or
Windows Subsystem under Linux.

=== Windows: Cygwin and/or WSL (Bill Mc.,  low priority)

If there is a demand,  a port to Cygwin will be attempted.

=== Other?

Are there other OS platforms that should be supported?
Other Linux distis?  Or will Docker support?

== Basic description
=== What Sail is
Sail is a domain-specific programming language that is
intended for specifying an ISA in as convenient and rigorous a manner as possible. Sail's main focus is verification. Once specified, a Sail program can be compiled to multiple backends:

- A C-model. This is an ISA simulator. It takes as input 
 a set of instructions (usually found in a .elf file), and runs them. The results observed.

- Various prover backends, including
  - Isabelle/HOL
  - HOL
  - Coq
  - SMT-LIB
  Since a processor is essentially a state transformer, the specification is translated to a logical formula that expresses  the state transition relation logically.

The model is a sequential model only;  at this time, 
there are no semantics allowing for any type of parallel
execution.  

=== What Sail is not

Sail is not an RTL (Register Transfer Language).
There is no direct support for timing (as in clock
timing) and there is no support for parallel execution,
all things that an RTL contains.

A mental model for Sail is that it lets you express what an **external** oberver, i.e. software can see of a processor. Sail is not about micro-architecture. 


== Sail compilation

=== Cambridge compiler

Sail has currently one main compiler, https://github.com/rems-project/sail[see here]. It currently compiles to the following backends.

1. Simulators (which run programs of the modelled ISA):
  - C simulator (this is the main one)
  - Ocaml simulator (exists mostly for historical purposes)

2. Logical theories (which render the description of the ISA in logical form) using the following logical systems:
    - Isabelle/HOL (see e.g. https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/tree/master/prover_snapshots/isabelle[here] for RISC-V models in HOL.)
    - HOL4
    - Coq
    - SMT-LIB 

Building the Sail system itself is a multi-stage meta-programming process, that the picture below captures in some detail.

image:./images/sail.svg[] 

=== Pydrofoil backend.

Sail was developed with a  emphasis on correctness and verification. One consequence is that the compiler from Sail to C is quite conservative in its optimisations, since correctness of compiler optimisatins is highly nonp-trivial. Hence generated C-simulators can be relatively slow. 

https://github.com/pydrofoil/pydrofoil[Pydrofoil] is a new tracing-JIT compiler for Sail, based on the https://www.pypy.org/[PyPy] meta-tracing framework. This is currently under active development. As of December 2022, support for infinite precision floating point arithmetic is  the main missing feature.




[#hello_world]
== “Hello, World” example program (Bill)
All example programs associated with this cookbook, 
can be found in 
<sail_git_root>/cookbook/functional_code_snippets/

The purpose of this simple program is to show some 
of the basics of Sail and to ensure that you have 
the Sail compiler (and the other required tools)
 installed in your environment.

It is assumed that you have built the sail compiler 
in the local area. The Makefiles in the coding 
examples depend on this.

The following code snippet comes from: 

https://github.com/billmcspadden-riscv/sail/tree/cookbook_br/cookbook/functional_code_snippets/hello_world

hello_world.sail:

// include doesn't appear to render in github
// Therefore, asciidoctor-reducer will be used to create
// a complete (all files included) file, which will be
// committed by git.  

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/hello_world/hello_world.sail[]
----

So... that's the code we want to compile.  But how do 
we compile it? Remember, we want to use the sail
compiler that was built in this sandbox.  We use a
'make' methodology for building.  The first Makefile
(in the same directory as the example code example) 
is very simple.  It includes a generic Makefile 
(../Makefile.generic) that is used for building 
most of the program examples.


[Note]  If you want to create and contribute your 
own example program and you need to deviate from 
our make methodolgy,  you would do that in your 
own test directory by writing your own Makefile.

The basic flow for building is:  

. Write *.sail  
. sail -c *.sail -o out.c 
. gcc <flags> *.c --> executable


Makefile:

[source, makefile]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/hello_world/Makefile[]
----

Makefile.generic is the Makefile that does the work for compilation.
It depends on a local compilation of sail. See the [Installation](#sail-installation)
section to understand how to install in the tools for your platform.

Makefile.generic:

[source, makefile]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/Makefile.generic[]
----

What does the compilation process look like?  Under Ubuntu Linux,  this
is the output you can expect for compiling and running the "hello world"
example program.

```
ubuntu-VirtualBox 227> make
SAIL_DIR=../../.. ; export SAIL_DIR ; \
../../../sail -c -o out hello_world.sail
gcc out.c ../../../lib/*.c  -lgmp -lz -I ../../../lib/ -o out
./out
hello, world!
hello, another world!
ubuntu-VirtualBox 228> 

```

Now that we've examined the Makefiles,  we will make little mention of them
in the rest of this document (except for the example where we discuss the 
C foreign function interface where we will show how Sail can call C functions).

=== "Hello, World" and the Sail interactive interpretter

This section is meant to introduce you to the the Sail interactive interpretter.
We will not go into much detail about running it;  we'll simply take you through the
hello_world example to show you how it is run.

'1. Invocation....

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_1.png[]

'2. Execute the main() function....

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_2.png[]

'3. Each "step" in the following images is caused by hitting the "enter" key.
This steps you from one statement to another.  Note the top line: we are being
told we are in the main() function.

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_3.png[]

'4. "enter"

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_4.png[]

'5. "enter".   We now see the body of the main() function.

'6. "enter"

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_6.png[]

'7. "enter"

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_7.png[]

'8. "enter". On the top line,  we see the output from the print()
statement, "hello, world".

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_8.png[]

'9. "enter"

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_9.png[]

'10. "enter"

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_10.png[]

'11. "enter".  And now we see the output from the second print statement
pn the top line.

'12. "enter"

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_12.png[]

'13. "enter"

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_13.png[]

'14. "enter".  We have completed executing the function. The
Result is printed out.

'15. ... and now  ... quit and exit....

image:images/sail_i_hello_world_15.png[]

=== How to print file name and location in print statements: `__FILE__, __LOC__`
[#print__FILE__LOC__] 
A relatively recent addition  to sail was the addition of the keywords
`__FILE__` amnd `__LOC__`.  These function in much the same way as in C.
`__FILE__` expands to the filename. `__LOC__` (similar to `__LINE__` in C) 
expands to the line number and character position where the keyword was
found.   These are useful for debug and error statments.

`printf__FILE__LOC__.sail`:

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/print__FILE__LOC__/print__FILE__LOC__.sail[]
----

The output from running the executable:

```
ubuntu-VirtualBox 259> make
SAIL_DIR=../../.. ; export SAIL_DIR ; \
../../../sail -c -o out print__FILE__LOC__.sail
gcc out.c ../../../lib/*.c  -lgmp -lz -I ../../../lib/ -o out
./out
hello, world!
file: print__FILE__LOC__.sail
loc:  print__FILE__LOC__.sail:20.27-20.34
ubuntu-VirtualBox 260> 
```

== Data types (and kinds)

Sail is a straightforward language, with one notable exception. Sail is designed to be a minimal language that is only good at one thing: writing ISA interpreters. It offers a lot of support that make this easy. 

- Infinite precision integer and floating point numbers
- String support for bits
- Strong support for bit vectors
- Convenient support for named bitfields
- Union types to support tracking state
- Effect annotations

The two most notable changes from normal languages are:

- Only first-order functions. So, unlike e.g. C or Python, we cannot pass functions as arguments, and can also not return functions.
- **Liquid types.** They may be the most unusual of Sail's features. They are a lightweight form of dependent types that can be used to prevent, at compile time, out-of-bounds errors and similar. To the best of our knowledge, Sail is the first non-experimental language with liquid types.


=== Infinite precision integer, naturals and floating point data types

All processors have finite precision arithmetic. The exact behaviour of
finite precision arithmetic is difficult to define correctly, since there are so many edge cases, to do with overflow, underflow and rounding. 

In the past, finite precision arithmetic was defined in an a  host language like C or C++ which  itself has 
finite precision arithmetic, typically not quite the same as that of the guest ISA to be defined. That is even more complex, because the specification  needed to deal with the cartesian product of the edge cases of both, the host language and the guest ISA.

Sail sidesteps this problem by providing infinite precision integer and floating point data types, which makes simplifies the problem a great deal, since the host language (Sail) has (almost) no edge cases.

Sail has 3 built-in infinite precision arithmetic types:

- Arbitrary precision integers: `int`
- Arbitrary precision naturals: `nat`
- Arbitrary precision reals: `real` (but no floating-point arithmetic). 

All are useable for specifying finite precision arithmetic.


### Range types:

- Integer ranges `range(′n,′ m)` where  he type `range(’n,’m)` is
an inclusive range between the `Int`-kinded type-variables `’n` and `’m`
- The type `int(’o)` is an integer
exactly equal to the `Int`-kinded type-variable `’n`, i.e. `int(’o)` = `range(’o,’o)`.

All these types can be used interchangeably provided the rules summarised in the below diagram are satisfied (via constraint solving). ![](images/conversion.png)

### Vectors
Let's start with an example:

    let v : vector(3, dec, int) = [1, 2, 3]

What do the three arguments mean?

- The first argument of the vector type is a numeric expression representing the length of the vector,

- `dec` is the order. Sail allows two different
types of vector orderings; increasing (inc) and decreasing (dec). Here is an example: ![](images/order.png)

- The last argument is the type of the vector’s elements.


Sail allows bitvector literals to be specified in:

- Hexadecimal, e.g. `0x12FE`
- Binary, e.g. `0b1010100`

*Note* that the length of a hex literal is always four times the number of digits, and
the length of binary string is **always** the **exact** number of digits, so `0x12FE` has length 16, while `0b1010100`
has length 7.

#### Accessing vectors. 

A vector can be indexed by using the vector[index] notation.
So, in the following code:
let v : vector(4, dec, int) = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let a = v[0]
let b = v[3]
a will be 4, and b will be 1 (note that v is dec). By default, Sail will statically check for out of bounds
errors, and will raise a type error if it cannot prove that all such vector accesses are valid.

#### Slicing  vectors.
 
 As a special case of access, vectors can be sliced using the

     vector[indexmsb .. indexlsb]

 notation. The indexes are always supplied with the index closest to the MSB being given first, so
- the bottom 32-bits of a
decreasing bitvector v as `v[31 .. 0]`,
- the upper 32-bits of an increasing bitvector as `v[0 .. 31]`,

i.e. the indexing order for decreasing vectors decreases, and the indexing order for increasing vectors
increases.

#### Updating vectors.   

A vector index can be updated using `[vector with index = expression]` notation. For example

    [v with 0 = bitzero]

We can also update subranges    using `[vector with indexmsb .. indexlsb = expression]`, where the
order of the indexes is the same as described above for increasing and decreasing vectors. Here is an example:

    [v with 37 .. 36 = 0b00]

Note that these expressions are  just syntactic sugar for the built-in functions `vector_access`, `vector_subrange`, `vector_update`, and `vector_update_subrange`.

#### Iterating over a vector in a type-safe way.
Here is an example:

    val f : forall 'n, 'n > 0. vector('n, dec, bits(5)) -> bool                                                                                                                                  function f ( regs ) = {                                                                                                                                                                         foreach ( x from 0 to (length(regs) - 1) ) {                                                                                                                                                    if ( regs[x][0] == bitone) then return true                                                                                                                                              };                                                                                                                                                                                             false                                                                                                                                                                                    }

### Bits and bit vectors

### Strings

- Strings

- `bit` type with members `bitzero` and `bitone`. Note: `bit` is **not** a numeric type, i.e. not `range(0, 1)`

=== Lists

Sail also has `list` as a built-in type. For example:

    let l : list(int) = [|1, 2, 3|]

where the list concatentation operator is `::` and the empty list is
`[||]`. Pattern matching is the sole (?) destructor for lists.  Note
that `list` is a generic type constructor, so you can do e.g.:

    val f : int -> list((int, list(int)))
    function f (n) = {                                                                                                                                                                                    [|(17,[|4|] )|]                                                                                                                                                                     }

Note that Sail currently does not have a concatenation operator. We
can write a monomorphic one, e.g.

    val concat_list : forall 'n, ('n > 0 ). ( list( bits('n) ), list( bits('n) ) ) -> list( bits('n) )                                                                                           function concat_list ( l1, l2 ) = {                                                                                                                                                             match l1 {                                                                                                                                                                                      x :: xs => (x :: ( concat_list( xs, l2 ) ) ),                                                                                                                                                [||] => l2                                                                                                                                                                                }                                                                                                                                                                                         }

but this is not currently accepted by the `-c` option. It is accepted
by the `-just_types` option.

=== Type variables
Many languages have generics.  In C++ you might see a template class definition like 

----
template <class T>
class C {
  private:
  T* p;
  public:
  T func(T t) { return t; }
};
---- 

This class is parameterised by `T` which is a placeholder for a type. We can instatiate `T` by other types. We call parameters like `T` a *type variable*. In Java we also have generics, e.g.

----
class C<T>{
    T t;
    void set(T t){this.t=t;}
    T func(){return t;}
}
----

Here, too *T* is a type variable.

Sail, too, has type variables. They are written `'n` with a tick. However, Sail does not have full generics in the sense of C++ and Java, where type variables can be instantiated by (almost) arbitrary other types. In Sail yype variables are used for liquid types, described below.

=== Kinding

Sail's types, especially liquid types,  are quite complex.
We must avoid forming syntactically invald types. In order to do that, Sail
uses a *kindind system* which can be seen as a typing system "higher up":

- Types guarantee that programs are syntactially 'sane'
- Kinds guarantee that types are syntactially 'sane'

The kinds that occur most often are

- `Int`, as used in e.g. `type xlen : Int = 32`
- `Type`, used like so, e.g.
   ----
      val not_implemented : forall ('a : Type). string -> 'a effect {escape}`                                                                                                                          ---- 
- 'Bool'
- In addition, we can form functions, e.g. `Int => Bool => Int'

The kinding for each built-in type can be found in the compiler
https://github.com/rems-project/sail/blob/sail2/src/lib/type_check.ml#L701-L721[src/lib/type_check.ml]


=== Effect annotations

Effect annotations are automatically inferred as of Sail v0.15.

### Implicits
Semantics of `implicit` keyword. So implicits, implicit parameters in
Scala and type classes in Haskell / Rust. The implicit keyword is very
restricted:

- Only usable for integer arguments,
- They have to be in the leftmost position.
  
Implicits are essentially used so if you have a return type, and they
type-checker knows the length of the return type (like in `bits('m)`)
you can have that available as a variable in the function body for
flow-typing etc. The type-checker will desugar it into a explicit
argument of type `int('m)` and add an explicit argument at each call
site. If the type system cannot figure out the implicit argument at
the call site simply it will just ask for it to be given explicitly.
In other words, if you have a function

```
val f: (implicit(’n), bits(’n)) -> bits(’m)
```

then you can write e.g.
    `g ( f ( arg ) )`
instead of
    `g ( f ( 64, arg ) )`
assuming the type-inferencer know that g has a type like
    `val g : bits(64) -> ...`

For an example of implicits see the RISC-V file
<code>prelude.sail</code> where we find:

```
val EXTS : forall 'n 'm, 'm >= 'n. (implicit('m), bits('n)) -> bits('m)
val EXTZ : forall 'n 'm, 'm >= 'n. (implicit('m), bits('n)) -> bits('m)

function EXTS(m, v) = sail_sign_extend(v, m)
function EXTZ(m, v) = sail_zero_extend(v, m)
```

Note also that this currently compiles:

```
default Order dec
$include <prelude.sail>

val f_gt : forall ('n 'm : Int), 'm > 'n. (implicit('m), unit) -> bits('n)
val f_lt : forall ('n 'm : Int), 'm < 'n. (implicit('m), unit) -> bits('n)
val lt : forall ('n 'm : Int), 'm < 'n. implicit('m) -> bits('n)
val gt : forall ('n 'm : Int), 'm > 'n. implicit('m) -> bits('n)

val h : forall ('n 'm : Int), 'm > 'n. (implicit('m), bits('n)) -> bits('n)
function h (size, bv ) = { bv }
```

Note that this is fine, because all we are doing is to declare
functions which can never be called in a type-safe way. This is a bit
like in e.g. System F types like

    forall X. X -> Unit
	
have 0 inhabitants. Still we can declare that type. Note also that the
pathologies above have nothing to do with the `implicit` keyword, e.g.

    val h_explicit : forall ('n 'm : Int), 'm > 'n. (bits('m), bits('n)) -> bits('n)
    function h_explicit (tmp, bv ) = { bv }

exhibits the same problem but id free from  `implicit`.


In order to get implicit resolution to work, we can also use

    ( bla : bits('n) )

instead of just

    bla

### Existential types 
The syntax for existentials is `{variables, constraint. type}`. ... In Sail, existentials, they really are just liquid types in disguise:
  
```
      {'n, C('n). int('n)}
```  
   
would be equivalent to the more traditional liquid type syntax
   
```
      {'n : int | C('n)}
```

The syntactic restriction we have is essentially that we can always
translate our existentials into that liquid form, as our syntax
   would allow something like `{'n 'm, C('n, 'm). T('n)}` where the `'m`
   type-variable does not occur in the type. Additionally we don't
   allow the variables in these existentials to be anything other than
   booleans and integers. When used within a datatype declaration D,
   our syntax is logically

```
   (exists n. T(n)) -> D
``` 

(but we omit the `-> D`` because we don't have GADTs) as opposed to

```
forall n. (T(n) -> D)
```


## Bidirectional mappings.

In ISA specifications, we often want to 'equate' types, for example 

    mapping encdec_bop : bop <-> bits(3) = {
      RISCV_BEQ  <-> 0b000,
      RISCV_BNE  <-> 0b001,
      RISCV_BLT  <-> 0b100,
      RISCV_BGE  <-> 0b101,
      RISCV_BLTU <-> 0b110,
      RISCV_BGEU <-> 0b111
    }
    
where we have an enumeration `bop` containing the symbolic names `RISCV_BEQ` etc. We can write  conversion functions like

    encdec_bop_forwards : bop -> bits(3)
    encdec_bop_backwards : bits(3) -> bop
    encdec_bop_forwards_matches : bop -> bool
    encdec_bop_backwards_matches : bits(3) -> bool

as separate functions. However, those functions can be autogenerated using bidirectional mappings. They are defined similarly to functions, with a val-spec and a definition. Currently, they only work
for monomorphic types. Their general syntax is:

    val name : type1 <-> type2
    mapping name = { pattern <-> pattern , pattern <-> pattern , . . . }

which can be shortened to

    mapping name : type1 <-> type2 = { pattern <-> pattern , pattern <-> pattern , . . . }

We can now simply write e.g.  `encdec_bop` for `encdec_bop_forwards` or `encdec_bop_backwards`, and the type-checker will disambiguate. (Note that this requires the LHS and RHS of `<->` to be different.)


=== Type declarations

Sail is a modern programming language, in the ML tradition and has
many forms of type constructors, in particular structs, unions, enums
and bitfields. TBC

=== Type declarations (1): Structs

Note, as of 28 July 2022,  pattern matching on structs is not possible. See https://github.com/rems-project/sail/issues/179

=== Type declarations (2): Unions 
=== Type declarations (3): Enums 
=== Type declarations (4): Bitfields

Bitfields are a staple of ISA specifications, and Sail offers convenient support for bitfields. Here is an example from the RISCV specification:

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/bitfields/example1.sail[]
----

A bitfield definition creates a wrapper around a bit vector type, and
automatically generates getters and setters for the fields, in case of the example `mtvec`, we have 

- Getter: `mtvec->bits()`
- Setter: `mtvec->bits() = ...`

for the whole bitvector, and for individual fields

- Getters:
    * `mtvec.Base()`
    * `mtvec.Mode()`  
- Setters: 
  * `mtvec.Base() = ...`
  * `mtvec.Mode() = ...`

The bitfield wrapper type will be the something like `union cr = { Mk_cr(bits(xlen)) }`
TODO: this example is too RISCV specific (requires `xlenbits`), use something more generic.

Here are some more examples.

    bitfield Uinterrupts : xlenbits = {                                                                                                                                                            UEI : 8,  /* external interrupt */                                                                                                                                                           UTI : 4,  /* timer interrupt    */                                                                                                                                                           USI : 0   /* software interrupt */                                                                                                                                                         }

autogenerates the following functions:

- `bits()`
- `UEI()`
- `get_UEI`
- `set_UEI`
- `update_UEI` (This one is pure, i.e. returns a modified copy, but leaves the original unchanged)

Assume we define

     bitfield Mstatush : bits(32) = {                                                                                                                                                               MBE  : 5,                                                                                                                                                                                    SBE  : 4                                                                                                                                                                                   }                                                                                                                                                                                            register mstatush : Mstatush

then we can do

     mstatush->bits() = 0b00000000000010101000000011100010;

to set the register `mstatush` in one go. For reading we do eg.

     mstatush.MBE()

while writing is like this

     mstatush->MBE() = 0b0;

=== Liquid data types 

From a programming language design point-of-view, Sail's liquid types might be its the novel and interesting feature. 
BTW, the name Liquid Types is a portmanteau of *L* og *i* cally *Qu* alified *D* ata Types. We expect liquid types to become more mainstream in the next decade.

ISA specification is drenched with bit-vectors. Assigning, e.g. a 32-bit vector to a 48-bit vector is almost always wrong. Likewise,
asking for the 19th bit of a 16-bit vector is most likely a
problem. In mainstream programming languages like C, C++ or Java, such
errors are typically only caught at run-time.  Liquid types exist to
catch such problems at *compile-time*.

With liquid types it is possible to type a function that thats an integer `n` and a bitvector of length `n`, and returns a bitvector of length `n*n`. The
typing system also ensure that all calls to such a function pass and receive bitvectors of appropriate size.

For the cognoscenti we remark that liquid types are a form of dependent types, since numbers like `m` and `n` are parts of types. But unlike general dependent types, which have undecidable type-inference, and type-checking, liquid types are suitably restricted so that, simplifying a bit, type-inference remains decidable (and is handled by an SMT solver, Z3 in the current implementation of Sail). 

We explain liquid types with a sequence of examples. First consider
----
val f1 : bits(48) -> bits(48)
function f1(bs) = bs
----

This function is the identity on 48-bit bitvectors. Naturally there is nothing special about 48 in this context. If it were not for types, 
----
function f1(bs) = bs
----
would handle 47-bits or 99-bits just as well. Note that this *not* generics in the sense of Java above, since numbers like 48 are not types in the conventional sense. (We will later elaborate on details.) So what we really want is something like
----
val f2 : forall 'n. bits('n) -> bits('n)
function f2(bs) = bs
----
Indeed, this is correct Sail. The `forall `n` is like C++'s `template <class T>` why the `n` in place of C++'s `T`, but one has to be careful because the correspondence is not too tight: C++ is a lot less principled than Sail.

Let's do something more interesting with liquid types: let's index into a bitvector in a type-safe way. We start with a function that is the identity on bitvectors, but *requires* that the bitvectors be non-trivial, meaning their size is greater than zero.
----
val f3 : forall 'n, ('n > 0). bits('n) -> bits('n)
function f3(bs) = bs
---- 

Let's also try and index into a bitvector and see how Sail prevents index-out-of-bounds errors at compile time. Consider
----
val f4 : forall 'n, ('n > 0). bits('n) -> bit
function f4(bs) = bs[0] 
----
But if we change `function f4(bs) = bs[0]` to `function f4(bs) = bs[17]` the compiler complains:
image:./images/sail-error1.png[]

If we change `forall 'n, ('n > 0). bits('n) -> bit` to e.g.
----
val f5 : forall 'n, ('n > 18). bits('n) -> bit
function f5(bs) = bs[17] 
----
the compiler is happy again. Let's do something a little bit more interesting. Here we have a function
----
val f6 : forall 'm 'n, ('m > 18 & 'm == 'n). (bits('m), bits('n)) -> bits('n)
function f6(b1, b2) =
         let b : bit = b2[7] in b1 + b2
----
that takes two bitvectors of length at least 19 that must also 
of the same lenth. It indexes one of them at index 7. Then it returns `b1 + b2` which is the pointwise logical sum of bits. (See  https://github.com/rems-project/sail/blob/sail2/lib/vector_dec.sail#L197-L205[vector_dec.sail] from Sail's standard library for a definition.)

*TODO:* add more complex examples

== A more complicated example

Tthe following example is one that shows  some nuances about the Sail type
system.  This example comes from Alasdair Armstrong who was asked to help with
an example of how to handle VLEN (Vector Length)  for the RISC-V Vector extension.
We wanted VLEN to be dynamically configurable and not a compile time setting.

== Operators
=== Adding a non-native operator:  shifts

In the Sail Manual,  we have the following table:

image:images/sail_operator.png[]

Note that there is no shift operator in the table.  And a shift operator is really
useful. Is there a method for adding an operator?  Yes,  there is.  And this example
shows how it is done,  and we'll do it for the shift-left and shift-right operators.
Here's the code, in 2 files:

`shift_operator.sail:`

----
include::../functional_code_snippets/shift_operator/shift_operator.sail[]

== Execution
=== Functions




[#my_replicate_bits]
=== The ``my_replicate_bits()`` function from the Sail manual (Bill)

First,  let's look at the code that is described in the Sail manual for the function, my_replicate_bits().  

Note:
The following code actually comes from the file 
doc/examples/my_replicate_bits.sail.  It is a little 
bit different than what is shown in the manual 
for reasons that will be covered later.

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_manual_example_my_replicate_bits/my_replicate_bits.sail[]
----

You will see in this code,  that there is no 'main' 
function,  and as such, will not compile into a C Sail
model.  You will get the following error message:

TODO: get the error message.

In order to get this to compile into a C Sail model,
you will need to provide a main function.  The 
following code shows the implementation of a 
`main()` function that calls my_replicate bits().

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_manual_example_my_replicate_bits/main.sail[]
----

Because both the files, my_replicate_bits.sail and 
main.sail, need to have the function signatures in 
order to compile (and we want them to be consistent),
the function signatures have been put into a seperate
file that is include by both.  Here is the function
signature file, my_replicate_bits_function_signatures.sail:

== Interaction between C and Sail

**Can we call Sail functions in the C model?**

Short answer: yes!

In more detail, every Sail function will show up with a predictable name in the generated C (with one caveat). For example, if have the following Sail code:

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_names_in_c/example.sail[]

----

then we get the following C code (abbreviated).

[source, c]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_names_in_c/example1.c[]
----

for `giraffe1` (and likewise for 'giraffe3'). Note that the  code for `giraffe2` is simply this:

[source, c]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_names_in_c/example2.c[]

----

So giraffe1 becomes `zgiraffe1`, `giraffe2` becomes `zgiraffe2`` and so on. If we only provide a
Sail declaration but no corresponding Sail implementation (as we do for `giraffe2`, we only get a C declaration. OTOH, 
if we only provide a Sail function but no separate 
Sail header, as we do for `giraffe3`,
we still get a C implementation and a separate prototype.

Note that all the `zgiraffe*` functions are global and can be called from C. This is done for example in the RISCV model, where the Sail functions 

- `tick_platform` https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/blob/master/model/riscv_platform.sail#L495
- `tick_clock` https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/blob/master/model/riscv_platform.sail#L319

are explicitly called in the handwritten C function

https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/blob/master/c_emulator/riscv_sim.c#L935-L936

Note that if you overload a functions `f1`, ..., `fn` to a new funtion `f` and then
call `f` in the Sail code, the generated C will not use `zf` but rather the appropriate `zfi`. For example


[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_names_in_c/example-overloading.sail[]
----

results in the following C snippet:

[source, c]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_names_in_c/result-overloading.c[]
----

Scattered definitions (typically used in the decode and execute clauses) might be seen as a form of overloading. Here is an example of a definition of `execute``:

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_names_in_c/example-execute.sail[]
----

Here the generated C will contain a single function `zexecute` that does a big `case`-distinction that dispatches to the relevant parts of the scattered definition:

[source, c]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_names_in_c/result-execute.c[]
----

**Warning.** The Sail compiler does aggressive  dead code elimination: Sail functions, like `giraffe4` which are not used (called) get eliminated and do **not** appear in the generated C code. 

**Note.** See https://github.com/rems-project/sail/issues/177

Here's another example of using the C foreign language interface...

[#Sail-Calls-C-function]
=== Sail Calls C function

Here is the sail code where we're trying to call a C function and
return a value to Sail.

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_calls_cfunc/sail_calls_cfunc.sail[]
----

Here is the C code,  in a .c and .h file.  The .h file is needed because
it needs to be included in the out.c file that Sail generates for the 
C simulator.

First,  the cfunc.h file ....

Here is the Makefile used to compile all of this.

[#Sail-Calls-C-function-for-YAML]
=== Sail Calls C function to get value from a YAML file

We now extend the example to show how you can get a value from a YAML
file and return it to the calling C function.

This example depends on the library, libfyaml.  You need to have this 
installed on your system in order to build the test.

Here's a simplified YAML file (it's part of the RISCV-Config file):

[source, yaml]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_calls_cfunc_for_yaml/rv32i_isa.yaml[]
----

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_calls_cfunc_for_yaml/sail_calls_cfunc_for_yaml.sail[]
----

The real work is done in the cfunc files.  Here is the C file that
opens a YAML file,  searches for the key,  and then returns the value.
(Note that there is also a cfunc.h file but we will not inspect it here.)

[source, c] 
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_calls_cfunc_for_yaml/cfunc.c[]
----

And finally,  here is the Makefile that builds the executable:

----
include::../functional_code_snippets/sail_calls_cfunc_for_yaml/Makefile[]
----






== Other stuff

## Non-determinism / undefined / IMPDEF

Sometimes we want to express underspecification and non-determinism.
Sail has a keyword, "undefined". I have not thought about this deeply,
maybe "undefined" makes it difficult to have constrained
nondeterminism? (E.g. this 64 bit register contains an undefined
number x, subjecet to the contraint that x is prime.)


[#pragmas]
=== Pragmas

Sail has a few pragmas, see the compiler in
https://github.com/rems-project/sail/blob/sail2/src/lib/preprocess.ml#L119-L139[`src/lib/preprocess.ml`]:

-      'define'
-      'include'
-      'ifdef'
-      'ifndef'
-      'iftarget'
-      'else'
-      'endif'
-      'option'
-      'optimize'
-      'latex'
-      'property' 
-      'counterexample'
-      'suppress_warnings'
-      'include_start'
-      'include_end'
-      'sail_internal'
-      'target_set'
-      'non_exec'

Note that  `property` and  `counterexample` are for SMT solvers.
The only difference beteween `$property` and `$counterexample` seems to be that the latter adds
- `(set-option :produce-models true)` as first line
- `(get-model)` as last line
of the produced output SMT-LIB file. Rest seems to be identical.



[#scattered-definitions]
=== Scattered definitions:  Why?  What are they?

When specifying an ISA,  you'd like to coalesce the defintions of an
instruction (or a set of instructions,  if they have some similarity to 
each other) into a single file.  One benefit of such organizational principles
is that you can take a single Sail file and import it into a text specification
when describing the instructions whithout having to tear apart a much larger
file.

Functions, unions and mappings are definitions that can be scattered amongst
multiple files.  Following is an example of scattered definitions of functions,
unions and mappings.

Here is the opening of the scattered definitions for this example:

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/scattered_definitions/scattered_definitions_begin.sail[]
----

Here is the top-level Sail module. Note that it calls 2 instances of
func(), the difference being the "argument" that is passed to it.  But it's
not really an argument;  the "argument" is used to decide which flavor of func()
should be called.

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/scattered_definitions/scattered_definitions.sail[]
----

The file, scattered_definitions_include.sail, is use to hold function signatures,
which get included in several files.

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/scattered_definitions/scattered_definitions_include.sail[]
----

Here are the 2 scattered definitions for func(),  found in 2 different files:

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/scattered_definitions/a.sail[]
----

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/scattered_definitions/b.sail[]
----

And here is where the scattered definition of func() is end'd.  The end'ing is
broken out into a separate file so that many (all?) scattered definitions can
be closed in the same place.  This should match the opening of scattered definitions
being done in one place.

[source, sail]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/scattered_definitions/scattered_definitions_end.sail[]
----

And finally, there is an order of compilation of Sail code that must be observed.
The scattered definitions must be compiled last.  As such,  the Makefile
specifies the compilation order as seen here:

[source, makefile]
----
include::../functional_code_snippets/scattered_definitions/Makefile[]
----

=== Variable argument list support 

There is no native Sail support for variable argument lists.  This is primarily
noticeable in the `print()` functions.  This limitation is worked around by
simply doing a set of appropriate print funtions.

== Description prelude.sail

prelude.sail contains the function signatures and implemenmtations
of many support functions.  

=== description of print, sext, equility etc.  standard template stuff
=== the C interface

[#simple_cpu_example]

== Simple CPU example (nand2tetris)

A famous computer science textbook, https://www.nand2tetris.org/[The Elements of Computing Systems], defines a simple 16 bit CPU. The entire ISA dedfinition fits in 220 lines  of Sail and about 80 lines of supporting C. Here is the Sail code, written by John Witulski and 
Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick. (See https://github.com/pydrofoil/pydrofoil/blob/main/pydrofoil/test/nand2tetris/[here] for the original code.)

----
include::./nand2tetris/nand2tetris.sail[]
---- 

The supporting C code is 
----
include::./nand2tetris/nandsupport.c[]
----
We also need the following header file.
----
include::./nand2tetris/nandsupport.h[]
